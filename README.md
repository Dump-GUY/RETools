# RETools
Random tools I made or otherwise just use for reversing quickly.

# PEDMPExtractor
* Search for PE files in a raw dump and display arch + pe file size to allow manual carving quickly

# REClass
* Live memory C, C++, and other structure rebuilding tool

# demumble
* C++ library with python wrapper to demangle Itanium and MSVC symbols on all platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows)

# JITCall 
* Command line application to JIT compile a calling stub around N number of dll exports with arguments provided the calling convention. Supports manual mapping to easily debug dllmain and can read binary files to pass arbitrary data as argument. Wait for execution by key press or int3.

# BlobRunner
* Allocate and run shellcode, print shellcode base and wait for execution by key press.
